                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my page!
                    <br />
                    A little bit about me - I am a web/software developer who is about to graduate from an intense hands-on
                    Software Systems Developer Program at BCIT. This journey was about learning and implementing projects with multiple technologies, working in teams
                    and being able to create meaningful solutions in a concise timeframe.
                    On the personal side I am a versatile person who loves spending time with family, trail running, skiing, reading books and learning about new cultures and languages
                    (on both human and programming spectrum). I have lived in 5 countries in the past, and I think of myself as an adaptable, communicative and a proactive person.
                    I hold a Bachelors of Arts from Simon Fraser University (major in Economics) and completed an exchange program
                    at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid a number of years back. <br />
                    I reckon that we live in an ever-changing world, and I strive to propell positive changes with the use of software. <br />
                    Lets connect.
